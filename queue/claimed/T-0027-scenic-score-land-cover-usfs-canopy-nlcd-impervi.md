## Brief

USFS Tree Canopy Cover and NLCD fractional impervious, both CONUS 30 m, both public domain.
canopy and (1 - impervious) are the two biggest terms in E - this is what separates a redwood road from a
strip-mall arterial.

RED: a fixture through a known industrial area must score high impervious; a fixture on Skyline must score high
canopy. Both from the raster, not hand-entered.

## Log
- 2026-09-07T14:20:00Z BLOCKER FOUND AND ROUTED AROUND, before the task started. The brief named USFS Tree Canopy Cover and NLCD fractional impervious from MRLC. Both were checked live: MRLC's S3 now returns 403 "Anonymous users cannot invoke requests against Requester Pays buckets", and a deliberately bogus key on the same bucket returns AccessDenied rather than 404 - so the bucket blocks ALL anonymous access, not one stale object. The landing pages carry no download href at all. Retrieval needs the MRLC interactive Viewer or an authenticated EarthExplorer/ScienceBase order. There is no guessable public URL; this is portal-only, confirmed, not a guess-and-give-up.
- 2026-09-07T14:20:00Z DECISION: use ESA WorldCover 2021 v200 instead. Verified live: https://esa-worldcover.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/v200/2021/map/ESA_WorldCover_10m_2021_v200_N36W123_Map.tif -> HTTP 200, 84 MB, anonymous, no auth. Tiles are 3 degrees; N36W123 covers 36-39N/120-123W, which contains the whole Bay Area. N36W126 (4 MB) is the mostly-ocean neighbour if the coast bbox needs it.
- 2026-09-07T14:20:00Z WHY IT IS A FAIR SWAP: WorldCover is 10 m (better than NLCD/TCC at 30 m) and its classes give both terms directly - Tree cover (10) and Shrubland (20) feed `canopy`, Built-up (50) feeds `impervious`. The scenic score needs FRACTIONS in a 150 m buffer, not absolute canopy percent, so class fractions are the right shape anyway. What we lose: TCC's continuous 0-100 canopy percent, and NLCD's calibrated impervious fraction. If the rank-order fixture set (T-0029) shows the redwood-vs-strip-mall discrimination is weak, revisit with a one-time manual MRLC clip hosted in our own R2 and pinned by sha256.
- 2026-09-07T14:20:00Z LICENCE: ESA WorldCover is CC-BY-4.0, which is NOT yet in KNOWN_LICENSES in services/etl/etl/manifest.py. The manifest validator will refuse the entry until it is added deliberately - that is the gate working. Add "CC-BY-4.0" there as part of this task, and carry the attribution string into LICENSE-DATA.
