## Brief

T-0332 R6 (owner ruling) scoped the honest failure to POST /plan's fresh plans (reroutes exempt). tripPlanner.ts,
loopPlanner.ts and isochronePlanner.ts each ship a route without consulting RouteScore; grep of services/api/src for
routeScoreOf finds only scenicPlanner.ts. MEASURE FIRST: what each planner returns, which recorded fixtures each test
suite drives (and their RouteScore, via Tests/Fixtures/t0332/oracle.py's reading), and whether a loop or a surprise
destination should refuse or re-pick (a Surprise Me that answers "nothing pretty" may be worse than a re-roll within
the same request cap, P-COST-04). Then the acceptance: whole-answer equality through each handler, the population
MISSED before / CAUGHT after by test name.
