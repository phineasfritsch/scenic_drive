## Brief

Geofabrik `california-latest.osm.pbf` -> `osmium extract` to the 9-county Bay Area bbox ->
`osmium tags-filter` to drivable ways + the POI allowlist. Prints a COUNT PER FEATURE CLASS and writes them to
`meta`, so `ops/sane` can assert bounds later (viewpoints >= 400 etc, per the plan's data gate).

RED: a filter that drops motorways entirely -> the drivable-way count falls outside bounds and sane exits 4.
