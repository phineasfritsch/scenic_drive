  - "RED BY NAME first: a test over a fixture way present in two overlapping windows asserting ONE score (T-0204 measured 160 of 190 seam ways with different scores across grid-a/grid-b: Mulholland Drive way 1533792498 0.6988 vs 0.7022; West Sunset Boulevard way 399301293 0.6308 vs 0.6372), red today, then green once the rank-normalisation reference (normalise_region's 'reference' population) is the whole region's, computed once and passed to every chunk"
  - "the LA clip (561,000 ways) scored in chunks that each finish in one foreground container call, the reference population recorded (count, sha256 of the reference table) and the seam re-measured: 0 of N seam ways differ; the three windows' top tens re-quoted"
  - "cd services/etl && python -m pytest tests -rs -o addopts= count line and zero skips; the touched module's ops/mutate population updated"

## Brief

From T-0204's real run (PR #113): osmium completes crossing ways, so the 190 ways on the -118.45 seam were scored
in both halves - and 160 of them got different scores, because rank-normalisation runs over whatever window the
way landed in. A score that depends on the clip is not an index; the router would see steps at every chunk seam.
normalise_region already takes a 'reference' population (T-0163) - the run never passes the region's.
